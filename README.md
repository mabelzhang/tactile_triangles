## Disclaimer
This subset of code has not been tested. There may be missing dependencies on packages.

It will be tested and instructions written, if I find the time.

However, all code files were extracted from packages of working code that were tested under ROS Indigo in 2015-2017.


## Dependencies
- ROS + Gazebo (tested under ROS Indigo)
- PCL
- Eigen
- `util` repository under this account.

Check out the repositories under ROS catkin workspace, e.g. `catkin_ws/src`, then run

`$ catkin build`
